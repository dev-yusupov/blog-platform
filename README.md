# BLOG PLATFORM

This is MIT Licensed Open-Source Blog Platform Project. I used Python as a programming language and for creating models and CRUD operations I used Django and Django REST Framework. 

To start the project you need to follow to the following steps:

###### 1. Clone the project from  GitHub
```
git clone https://github.com/dev-yusupov/blog-platform.git
```

As a second step, which you need to follow, you have to create a virtual environment inside Git Repository, which you already cloned from GitHub.

###### 2. Copy and paste the following command to create .venv and enabling it.

```
python -m venv .venv

.venv\scripts\activate.bat (for Windows users)
```

After that, download all the dependencies as well.

###### 3. To complete this task just type following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start local server on your machine, you find the following command useful

```
python manage.py runserver
```
